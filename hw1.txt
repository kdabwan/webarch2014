- Your experience with web archtecture. Have you written HTML before? Written Javascript? etc.I’m a Computer Science major. All the classes I have taken were about algorithms and coding program whether it’s in Java, C or Python etc.  None of my experience related to web development come from school. The limited experience I have came form my personal interest – I’m glad that ischool is offering this course. A couple years ago I played around with HTML+CSS template and I was able to read its code and edit it to good level. I published it to a real domain and it was online for a while. My recent web development experience was with PHP. I learned some of its basics during this summer. I had to come up with a simple PHP API for a personal iOS project app. The app requires a remote MYSQL database and to make it interact with database, PHP was the easies solution for me. I’m hoping this course will introduce me to a better a experience. - What are your favorite features from at least 2 browsers?The most browser I use for my daily Internet activities is Google Chrome. It has a neat UI design, fast browsing and numerous beneficial extensions. The way Chrome display list of favorite links on toolbar is convenient and quick way to go to favorite links without further clicks. There’s no need to click on Favorite Folder icon to reach favorite links as it’s done on IE. The new feature I use on Chrome is a Time and Weather extension that get displayed whenever I click to create a new Tab.The other browser I use is sometimes is IE. It has a full compatibility with all of the online government applications and others. It’s also the right browser for install manual CA certificates for business.
